# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem was it solving.
I created an app that builded a linked list, making sure to keep track of both the head and tail nodes for a contact list.

# What did you do particulary well?
I believe keeping my codes organized and clean is what I did particularly well. Along with using appropriate naming standards for functions and variables.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etc?
I could enhance my code by using more best practices. With this project particularly, I did not leave comments but doing so would've ensured myself and others what was happening in whichever section of code they were reviewing. 

This would improve the quality of my program by understanding exactly what is happening in each class, method call, etc instead of guessing.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The piece of my code I found challenging was understanding the difference between public and private classes.

To help me with this project, I used my online zybook and YouTube.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work? 
The skills which I believe would be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work is problem solving, self-motivation, perseverance, data structure, and algorithm fundamentals. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable because if another developer were to try to make changes to the program, they would be able to read and understand the program without running into the risk of not knowing what to do in oder to make any significant changes if need be. Therefore, they would be able to easily modify, test, and fix a problem.
